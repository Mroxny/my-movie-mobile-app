Description
====
**` ACCOUNT RQUIRED, contact me: mroxny12@gmail.com `**

I am currently testing the application on a small group of people and login details are required to access it. Contact me to get them

In this app you can add recently watched movies or rate movies already added by others. This app is the best way to remember the movies you've watched. It allows you to connect to the database and share your thoughts on the movie with other users

Enjoy!
